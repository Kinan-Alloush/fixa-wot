            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Since my first attempt in 1996, I have compiled many top-10 lists of the biggest mistakes in Web design. 
                See links to all these lists at the bottom of this article. 
                This article presents the highlights: the very worst mistakes of Web design. (Updated 2011.)

            <h2>1. Bad Search</h2>
            <p>
                Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they're unable to handle typos, plurals, hyphens, and other variants of the query terms. 
                Such search engines are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/">particularly difficult for elderly users</a>, but they hurt everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
                A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis of how many query terms they contain, rather than on each document's importance. 
                Much better if your search engine calls out "best bets" at the top of the list — especially for important queries, such as the names of your products. 
                Search is the user's lifeline when navigation fails. Even though advanced search can sometimes help, 
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/">simple search usually works best</a>, and search should be presented as a simple box.

            <h2>2. PDF Files for Online Reading</h2>
            <p>
                Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing, because it breaks their flow. 
                Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because standard browser commands don't work. 
                Layouts are often optimized for a sheet of paper, which rarely matches the size of the user's browser window. 
                PDF is great for printing and for distributing manuals and other big documents. 
                Convert any information that needs to be browsed on screen into real web pages.

            <h2>3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links</h2>
            <p>
                Users benefit when visited links change color. This helps them track past navigation and avoid revisiting pages unnecessarily.
                When visited links don't change color, users often revisit the same pages repeatedly.

            <h2>4. Non-Scannable Text</h2>
            <p>
                A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. Intimidating. Boring. Painful to read. 
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/">Write for online</a>, not print. Use well-documented tricks to support scannability:

                <li>Bulleted lists</li>
                <li>Highlighted keywords</li>
                <li>Short paragraphs</li>
                <li>The inverted pyramid</li>
                <li>A simple writing style</li>
                <li>De-fluffed language</li>
            </ul>
